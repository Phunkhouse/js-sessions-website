pageTitle: Homework - Find an element
date: 2019-08-22
excerpt: Figure it out!
---

* Copy this array:
````Javascript
var elements = ['DIV', 'IMG', 'SPAN', 'SECTION', 'MAIN', 'SPAN'];
````
* **TASK:** Create a function that will loop through following array and tell you whether it founds element passed to an argument. If it founds nothing, tell user that it founds nothing too.
* **"Be gentle!" difficulty**: You are allowed to use console.log inside a function
* **"Bring it on!" difficulty**: Using console.log inside a function is forbidden
* **"I own Doom!" difficulty**: Log also the name of the element
* **"Watch me die!" difficulty**: Log also how many elements you found (try it on the SPAN one)

(Sorry for Doom references - they are just difficulties "Bring it on!" is a normal one. Cannot help myself.)
