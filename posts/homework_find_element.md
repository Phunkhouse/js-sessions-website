date: 2019-08-22
excerpt: Figure it out!
---

* Copy this array:
````Javascript
var elements = ['DIV', 'IMG', 'SPAN', 'SECTION', 'MAIN', 'SPAN'];
````
* Create function that will loop through following array and tell you whether it founds element passed to an argument. If it founds nothing, tell user that it founds nothing too.
* **"Be gentle!"**: you can use console.log inside a function
* **"Bring it on!"**: using console.log inside a function is forbidden
* **"I own Doom!"**: log also the name of the element
* **"Watch me die!"**: log also how many elements you found (try it on the SPAN one)

(Sorry for Doom refferences. Cannot help myself.)
