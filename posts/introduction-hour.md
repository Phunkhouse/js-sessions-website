date: 2019-06-27
excerpt: Introduction, instalation of of needed tools and some first steps to the land of Variables.
---

### Why are we here?
* Workload, clients requirement
* Importance of learning JS - future career

### This hour
* Setup of required tools (OneDrive, VS Code, Node JS)
* (optional) First steps -  Variables, console.log, Commenting

### Future hours
* Style of future coding sessions
  * introduction -> basics (lot of small challenges) -> advanced (few more complex challenges) -> real world scenarios (possibly one challenge per hour)
  * not a teamwork - but not against it
  * solving challenges: google it -> ask teammate -> ask me

### Setup
* OneDrive
* VS Code
  * how to go straight to the folder
  * command prompt intro
* Node JS

## Variables
* storage for your data
* it's variable - thus it could change value
* example of basic variable declaration with a string value:

````Javascript
var example = 'This is example string';
````

* donâ€™t use numbers or symbols as a first character ($, _ are exceptions)

<br>

### CH1: Microsoft thoughts
* create variable **microsoft** and give it value of **first thing that you though about if someone says it**
* log to the console

<br>

* Which data could variable accept? (strings, numbers, booleans and more complex ones)
* Do you want to use multiple words? Use **camelcase**:

````Javascript
var reallyLongVariableName = 'It is still somehow readable';
````

### CH2: Insane math
* create variable **insane math for pro users** (use camelcase)
* let it compute **2 + 4**
* log it

<br>

* you can insert variables inside a strings - **concatenation**:

````Javascript
var name = 'Otakar';
var hello = 'Hello, my name is ' + name;
// Hello, my name is Otakar
````

### CH3: Emotional string
* create varable **emotional string**
* give **emotional string** a value - **'I am a really sad string'**
* lets make him happy
* create variable **emotion** - above that sad string variable, and give it a value **'happy'**
* delete static **'sad'** value and insert here dynamic one - **emotion** variable
* log that happy string
