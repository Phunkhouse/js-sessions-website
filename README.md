What tools were used:
---
* [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) as a cool pure JS static site generator
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for fantastic, simple and free project hosting
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for simpler setup
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) with great [Hugo Giraudel's Architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/) - that is with combination with [BEM](http://getbem.com/) useful even for that small site
* [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) library for better syntax highlighting of code snippets
